## 📚 Project Structure
```
📦 Face-Recognition-Attendance  
 ┣ 📚 faces/              # Stores captured face images  
 ┣ 📝 app.py              # Main application script  
 ┣ 📝 students.csv       # Student data with face encodings  
 ┣ 📝 attendance.csv     # Attendance records

## 🔍 How It Works
1️⃣ **Register Student**: Captures and stores a student's face encoding.  
2️⃣ **Train the model**: The system learns to recognize stored faces.  
3️⃣ **Mark Attendance**: Recognizes faces in real-time and records attendance.
