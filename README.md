# 📸 Face Recognition-Based Attendance System

🚀 A smart **AI-powered attendance system** that uses **face recognition technology** to automate attendance marking. This system eliminates manual roll calls and enhances security by ensuring only authorized individuals are marked present.

---

## 🌟 Features
✅ **Real-time face detection & recognition**  
✅ **Automatic attendance logging**  
✅ **Secure and efficient processing**  
✅ **User-friendly GUI for easy operation**  
✅ **Stores attendance records in a database or CSV**

## 🔍 How It Works
1️⃣ **Capture faces**: The system captures and registers user faces.  
2️⃣ **Train the model**: The system trains itself to recognize stored faces.  
3️⃣ **Recognize & Mark Attendance**: The camera detects and verifies faces, marking attendance in real-time.
